# STM32F103C8 "Blue Pill"

# NOTE:
# There is a fair bit of confusion about whether the "Blue Pill" has 128kB or 64kB flash size.
# The most likely cause is that there exist a -C8 and a -CB variant of the STM32F103, where
# the C8 has 64kB, the CB has 128kB as per specification. "Blue Pill" boards are manufactured
# by a lot of different vendors, some may actually use the CB variant but from a cursory look
# it very hard to tell them apart ("C8" and "CB" look very similar). Nevertheless, people have
# tried using the full 128kB of flash on the C8 and found it to be working. Hence this board file
# overrides the internal size detection. Be aware though that you may be using you particular
# board outside of its specification. If in doubt, comment the following line.
set FLASH_SIZE 0x20000
